Some experience to use Synology NAS
The infomation is collected from network and reorganized.

- When I use JumpCloud LDAP in the Synology NAS, there are something strange. 
-- what the Base DN to use
-- which user can bind the LDAP Service
-- plain text password only?
-- group list has all users?
-- I can't see groups that new created


I hope it can help someone. If there is something incorrect, please let me know.
Thank you.
